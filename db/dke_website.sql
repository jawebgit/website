DKE was chartered on November 14th, 1890 as the tenth MIT fraternity. It was founded by members of a local society, Alpha Gamma Kappa, that had been established to petition for a new DKE charter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, the DKE house stands in the middle of the West Campus, along dorm row between Baker House and Burton-Conner, along with a few fellow fraternities. DKEs are actively involved in all facets of campus life from varsity and club athletics, to The Tech, to community service</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History of Delta Kappa Epsilon</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://dke.mit.edu/assets/dkecrestold-f1128b640a1c22270e852c8767fb63e7.png" style="float:left; height:226px; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; width:195px" /> In the spring of 1844 at Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, a number of men of high character and scholastic attainment did not receive bids from the campus&#39; two fraternities. This unfair act, which was due to undergraduate politics and a division in the Sophomore class, caused some men who did in fact receive bids to promptly reject them. Together, these men created a new society, founded in a meeting on June 22, 1844 in room Number 12, Old South Hall. Here, both the fraternity&#39;s secret and open Greek mottos were devised. The open motto being &quot;Kerothen Philoi Aei,&quot; which in English means &quot;Friends from the Heart, Forever.&quot; The DKE pin was also created with the Greek letters of DKE on a white scroll upon a black diamond with a gold rope trim and a star in each corner, as well as the colours crimson, blue, and gold. The chapter started with it&#39;s 15 founders deeming itself Phi of Delta Kappa Epsilon. To this day, it is the only fraternity at Yale that has never gone inactive. Within three years, chapters were founded at Bowdoin, Princeton, Colby College, and Amherst College. Since that time, DKE has grown to over 64 chapters and initiated over 85,000 members across North America. The fraternity is inextricably linked to the history of the United States of America, as its members include a whopping 5 of the 44 presidents, including both George Bush&#39;s Rutherford B. Hayes, Teddy Roosevelt, and Gerald Ford. The first west coast chapter was founded at UCal Berkeley in 1876, which was followed by their rival Stanford in 1901. DKE became an international fraternity with the addition of the Alpha Phi chapter in 1898 at the University of Toronto in Canada.</p>\r\n', '2015-01-26 06:13:30', '2015-05-16 09:50:22'),

I hope that you have been able to find all of the information you desired in visiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am very proud to say that over the past year our chapter has continued its tradition of excellence and leadership on the MIT campus. This was made possible by a dedicated and passionate group of actives in addition to the outstanding officers who have served with me over the past semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jake Laux &#39;14 has done an excellent job as the chapter&#39;s Vice President and Risk Manager, ensuring that our social events occur in a safe and responsible manner. John Halloran &#39;15, the House Treasurer, has been outstanding with the extremely challenging job of managing the chapter&#39;s finances. Joe Cunningham &#39;16 has done very well as House Manager, keeping the house clean in addition to maintaining and updating it. Luther Banner III &#39;16, the house Social Chair, did a great job of occasionally taking our minds of academics with an assortment of parties and mixers over the course of the semester. Last but certainly not least, Doug Nmagu &#39;14, the House Steward, has done an exceptional job in ensuring that the brothers are happy with the meal plan and formal, along with keeping a close relationship with our chef, Dan West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you come by the DKE house this year, you will see some new faces. Thanks to our recruitment chair, Will Waste &#39;14, we had a successful rush in 2013 that resulted in 12 new members pledging Delta Kappa Epsilon. We are very excited to welcome Andrew Titus, Bradley Walcher, Christian Argenti, Christopher Sanfilippo, David Houle, Kevin Kusch, Matthew Iovino, Matthew Lindsay, Ryan Karnish, Seth Studebaker, and Travis Herbanek as the Sigma Tau pledge class of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, the brothers of Delta Kappa Epsilon at MIT have continued their participation and leadership in athletics. The MIT Football team, which finished the season with 6 wins this year, sported 37 DKE brothers and pledges, including 3 brothers as team captains. In 2013, DKE saw 9 brothers earning ALL-NEFC honors and 3 brothers earning Academic All-District honors. One of our brothers, Joesph Campion &#39;15, is helping represent MIT as a member of the Basketball team. Tim Wilson &#39;14 will continue his role as a relief pitcher for the baseball team this spring when practice resumes. Actives Ben Greenberg &#39;15, and alumni Will Vega-Brown &#39;11 all still actively participating in MIT&#39;s Jiu Jitsu club. Finally, Cosma Kufa &#39;16, our chapter&#39;s Intramural Chair, has done a great job increasing our involvement in intramural sports at MIT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we look forward to a new year, we perform the sad duty of saying goodbye to the senior class. Many of the graduating class are leaving MIT to start their careers in a number of different fields, and the rest will be off to graduate school. Whatever their destination, we wish them the best of luck and hope they will always remember the good times they had here at Delta Kappa Epsilon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin Wallace &#39;15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Tau Chapter</p>\r\n', '2015-01-26 06:13:30', '2015-01-26 06:13:30'),

Considering the current costs of housing in the Boston area, the possibility of renting a room at one of the MIT Fraternities would be an absolute bargain.\r\nA little bit about myself:\r\nI graduated MIT course 11 back in 1998 (yes, class of 1998), I have been up and down the east coast ever since, I was a New York City resident for a significant portion of that time. (Including survival of the 9/11 attacks). I currently work in Cyber Security for a major Financial Institution and the position allows me flexibility of where I can live and work.    \r\nSo why am I looking for a room in an MIT fraternity for the summer? \r\nAs in my previous statement, cost is definitely a factor, but most importantly I am hoping to obtain summer housing in the Boston area for the following reasons:\r\nMy younger brother, who is active duty military, is currently stationed at Hanscom Air Force base. He lives on base with his wife and 2 children (my niece and nephew). My brother has just received his orders for deployment and will be headed to Afghanistan within a few weeks. His deployment is expected to last 6 months. My younger brother has asked for me to provide support for his family by staying in the Boston area while he is away.  I figure if I can stay in Boston for the summer, and visit his family regularly during the summer, it would provide them with the needed support and comfort during what will be an obvious period of difficulty and stress.\r\nIn any case, I look forward to your response as to whether or not you still have any spaces for rent.  Although not absolutely necessary, a parking spot would be a great benefit as well. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLuis Uribarri\r\n1998 Course 11\r\nuribarri@alum.mit.edu\r\n', 2, 'IFC Website', 0, 1, NULL, '2015-05-01 06:51:58', '2015-05-01 06:51:58'),
